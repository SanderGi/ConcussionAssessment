# Online Sport Concussion Assessment

An online sport concussion assessment for student athletes in Washington State. Made in collaboration with Aureole (she was responsible for user testing and getting it approved by the BMJ). The goal is to make these tests easier to access and remove some of the subjective nature of the tests. The tool also allows coaches to easily compare results over time to make more informed decisions about player health. URL: [https://scat6-web.web.app/](https://scat6-web.web.app/)

# Privacy Notice
*Last updated: September 18, 2025*

We respect your privacy. This notice explains what personal data we collect, how we use it, and your rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

## 1. Who we are
Volunteers working on an open-source concussion assessment software.
Contact: scat6@sandergi.com

We are the data controller for the processing described here (except where Google acts as an independent provider, e.g., Google Drive storage).

## 2. What data we collect
- When you use the app without logging in:
  - All health-related data stays on your device.
  - We do not collect or access this data by default.
- When you log in with Google (optional):
  - Firebase (by Google) stores your email address, the first login time, and the most recent login time.
  - You can use this login to sync data to your personal Google Drive. We cannot access the files in your Google Drive. Google processes that data under [its own privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).
- When you choose to upload data to us:
  - You may share pseudonymized usage data (data that does not include your name or email but could still be linked back to you in theory).
  - You may share feedback and ratings anonymously or with an email attached.
  - We use this data only to improve the app/website and concussion tools in general by publishing aggregate analysis and results.

## 3. Legal basis for processing
We process your personal data based on:

- **Consent** – when you choose to log in with Google or upload pseudonymized data.
- **Legitimate interest** – limited technical logging by Firebase to keep the service secure and functional.

## 4. Where your data is processed
- Firebase and Google services may process data outside the EU, including in the United States.
- Transfers are protected by the EU–US Data Privacy Framework and/or Standard Contractual Clauses.

## 5. How long we keep data
- Login data (email, login times) is retained for as long as your account exists.
- Pseudonymized uploads are kept only as long as necessary for improving the app.
- You may request deletion at any time (see below).

## 6. Your rights
Under GDPR, you have the right to:
- Access your personal data.
- Correct inaccurate data.
- Request deletion of your data.
- Object to certain processing.
- Withdraw consent at any time (for example, by deleting your account or stopping uploads).

To exercise your rights, contact us at scat6@sandergi.com.

## 7. Contact
If you have questions or concerns, please contact:
scat6@sandergi.com

If you are in the EU, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.
